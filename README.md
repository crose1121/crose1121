ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Corey!
Full-stack software developer and coder. Currently looking for work. I love working on teams as well as solo projects. Always eager to learn more from others, level up my skills, and collaborate on new projects.

Check out 'rw', it's my personal project (Read it and Weep). A social media site which is 'story-based' rather than 'user-based'. Tell your life stories, follow and tag users, search stories by users and categories, like stories and leave comments. All written in Java. Here's the link: http://44.203.70.167/ Also the 'rw' repository is publicly available.

<!---
crose1121/crose1121 is a âœ¨ special âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
You can click the Preview link to take a look at your changes.
